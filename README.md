# Facial EMG Data Collection Protocol

This repository contains the implementation files for collecting facial EMG data using a wireless Data Acquisition Unit (DAU) and screen-printed electrode arrays.

## Overview

This system enables the collection of facial electromyography (EMG) data using a non-invasive electrode mask setup. The protocol is designed for recording muscle activity during various facial expressions, making it valuable for research in:

* Facial expression analysis
* Muscle activity studies
* Human-computer interaction research
* Behavioral studies

## Protocol Reference

The complete step-by-step protocol can be found in:
